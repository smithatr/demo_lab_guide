### **Lab 01: Launch an EC2 Instance in AWS**
Estimated Time: 30â€“45 minutes 

### Lab Overview
An Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance is a scalable computing resource provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). EC2 allows users to launch and manage virtual servers in the cloud, enabling them to run applications, host websites, and perform compute tasks without investing in physical hardware.

### Lab Objectives

In this lab, you will be able to complete the following tasks:

- Launch an EC2 instance in the AWS Management Console.
- Connect to the instance using SSH (Linux).

#### Task 01: Create an EC2 instance

In this task, we will launch an Amazon Linux EC2 instance

1. On the **AWS Management Console**, use the search bar at the top to enter **EC2** (1), then select **EC2** (2) under Services to open the EC2 Dashboard. ![My EC2 Launch Image](images/1%20(1).png)
